<h4>Shovels</h4><p><br><br>
<b>Cricket bat</b><br><br>
A simple bat made of cheap metal. Not exactly the best choice for digging, but better than nothing.
<br><br>
<b>Shovel</b><br><br>
An oversized trowel, more fit for gardening purposes than excavations, but still more useful than the cricket bat.
<br><br>
<b>Folding spade</b><br><br>
A military grade entrenching tool with a telescopic handle. Light, durable, reliable and suitable as weapon of last resort.
<br><br>
<b>MOOSE</b><br><br>
The “Moon soil entrencher” is an nuclear powered digging tool, developed by Orbital during the preparations for the moon landing. When supplied with an uranium power rod the diamond-tipped pan of the shovel begins to vibrate at high frequencies, making loosenging the ground much easier.<br><br>

<b>Rusty shovel</b><br><br>
A hand-made tool back from the “good ol’ days” before corporations and their mass products took over. While they were crafted quite skillfully and mine any soil at speeds only matched by the MOOSE, their durability has severly deteriorated.
<br><br>





<a id="picks"></a>
<h4>Pickaxes</h4><p><br><br>
<b>Scrap pick</b><br><br>
A pick, found in the scrap. Scrap pick.<br><br>

<b>Metal pick</b><br><br>
A makeshift pick made of ... metal! Better at prying away loose metal plates from cocoon walls than the scrap pick, which is found in the scrap. Obviously.<br><br>

<b>Hand drill</b><br><br>
An manually operated drill and a scavenger's best friend. It opens gearboxes, batteries, safes, wiring, nuclear power cores and uranium reactors.

<b>MAN-Drill</b><br><br>
The Micro activity nucleus (MAN) drill was developed for and deployed by Orbitals sub-contractor responsible for the construction of the H.I.V.Es.<br>
After the initial excavations for the first cocoons, they met layers of neigh impenetrable rock no one had anticipated.<br>
Unable to fulfill their contracts, the contractor went bankrupt but was subsequently bought by Orbital Industries.
O.I’s engineers developed a lightweight, diamond-tipped hand drill in record time. To catch up with schedule, Mr.History authorized the incorporation of costly uranium power rods into the design. This required radiators to be attached to both sides of the drill and makes handling the drill, without protective gear or external cooling, somewhat dangerous.<br>
Needless to say that the H.I.V.E. project became a success, unlike Orbitals other big project...<br><br>

<b>Rusty hand drill</b><br><br>
Just like the rusty shovel, this tool has seen better days. Fast when drilling through metal walls, it’ll break when trying to drill through anything more durable.<br><br>
