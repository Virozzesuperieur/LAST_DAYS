<b>Stoneback leather armor</b><br><br>

A crude set of clothing made out of the durable hide of the stoneback, for those prefering survival over fashion.
After hunting down and skinning a stoneback, the hide needs to be dryed (and if possible tanned) for some time before it can be processed any further.<br>
While the smell of the hapless previous skin-owner never quiet dissipates, the armor protects its wearer from minor injuries and harsh weather (excluding lightning).<br><br>


<b>Metal armor</b><br><br>

A set of mixed sports and work protectors, reinforced with iron plating.
The chestpieces can be identified as part of a cocoons rugby equipment, the head part is a welder’s helmet.
While the metal armor is a preferable alternative over the stoneback armor in direct combat, its ragtag design leaves you open to sneak attacks from behind and provides less protection against the elements.
Swimming in this heavy armor is also not advised, should you ever come across a pool of clean water.<br><br>


<b>Uranium powered armor Mk 235</b><br><br>

One of Orbitals more recent developments before the Event, this set of heavy sealed armor provides the wearer with excellent protection against any source of damage*. However it’s incredibly hard to come by, let alone, reverse-engineer it.<br>
Another problem is the armors constant need for uranium power rods, otherwise the wearer will be stuck in an unmoving, 200 kg (440 lbs) heavy metal shell, which is quiet a nuisance in a deserted wasteland.
The armor should only be worn when needed, otherwise you risk looking like a tool.<br>
Oh, and you might contract long-term, third degree radiation burns on the torso and head from the power rods.<br>
*The armor is not impervious to sources of concentrated radiation and doesn’t come with a rebreather. Go figure.<br><br>


<b>Hazmat suit</b><br><br>

In a world plagued by radiation, a protective suit is worth its weight in gold. If only gold was still worth anything.<br>
While not the ideal choice for Huggatron hunting, this golden apparel is trusted to protect in irradiated environments, on both the earth and the moon!
Even today the personnel stranded in the Belly still wear a white edition of these suits, keeping them safe from all-
Wait… they did mutate, right? Maybe not such a bright idea to invest into a hazmat suit after all…<br><br>


<b>Jane Mail’s armor</b><br><br>

A plagiarism of Orbital Industries U-235 armor, created after the Event.<br>
Trying to make money of the peoples hysteria, a businesswoman named Jane Mail produced cheap, but impressive looking, replicas and sold them at horrendous prices.<br>
While durable, they offered hardly more physical protection than a hardware-store-grade hazmat suit.
They are hardly ever seen around the wastes and no one ever tried to rebuilt one.<br><br>
