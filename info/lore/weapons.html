<b>Scrap plank</b><br><br>

This blunt club hardly deserves its designation as a weapon, as it can’t be used for much more than bludgeoning giant rats to death.<br><br>


<b>Lead pipe</b><br><br>

A makeshift weapon made out of a few random pipe sections. Hollow on the inside, painfully stable on the outside.<br><br>


<b>Knock-o-matic Sledgehammer</b><br><br>

The K.o. is a sledgehammer with a twist! An inbuilt flywheel conserves momentum when the hammer is moved around. Upon impact the force is unleashed in a second burst, allowing more efficent processing of work pieces and alleviated decapitation of foes.<br><br>


<b>Cattle prod</b><br><br>

For reasons unknown, some big wheel at Orbital decided that all cocoons should be supplied with a set of cattle prods. With no surviving cattle that would tolerate prodding, the prods can be used as a viable weapon when overcharged with uranium power rods.
Just don’t touch the buzzing end.<br><br>


<b>Analytic Probe<br><br>
</b>
A multi-purpose tool employed by Orbital Industries scientist, mostly to study various factors of the moons environment. While not a weapon per se, it’s capable of giving of low current shocks, intended to determine a substances conductance.
Single shocks are ignorable for any healthy human, but present a danger when recieved in large dosages. Packs of mutated scientist, bent on probing places where the sun doesn’t shine, should not be trifled with...<br><br>


<b>Fire arm</b><br><br>

While the name is quite general by our standards it speaks volumes in the wastes. It combines various elements of pre-war weapons technology into a single simplified form. It is used to fire projectiles which are tipped with a metal shard and tailed with a small fuel compartment which is ignited as it is fired. Between the tip and the fuel compartment is a hallow aluminum tube. The Fire Arm is the primary tool of bandits in the waste due to its convenience and surprising accuracy (if assembled correctly).<br><br>
